                        <ul>
                            <li>Follow the instructions to reach the Scottish village.</li>

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>With this being a guide campaign, the objectives are quite simple and easy to follow while you learn
                    the controls and mechanics for the game. As the objective says, just follow the instructions as the
                    narrator explains what to do.
                    Just order your army to walk to the flags, find the village and defend it against the enemy forces.
                    There are Hints and Scouts tabs at the beginning of the mission that give you useful advice on how
                    to play the missions. You can drag your click you mouse over your forces, or group them together,
                    and hover your mouse over enemy forces and right click to attack them.

                <p>This mission shows you how to train troops. Specifically, you need to train 4 militia from the
                    Barracks. Click a villager to build a Barracks, then see how much the unit costs (in this case: 1 x
                    Militia - 60 Food 20G old, so you will need 240 Food and 80 Gold to complete the objective).

                title="Age of Empires II - Campaign: William Wallace - Mission: The Battle of Stirling"></iframe>
            <h4>Mission Debrief</h4>
            <div class="aoeObjectivesList">
                <ul>
                    <li>Objectives:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Defeat the English army and destroy their Watch Tower</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>This mission allows you to explore the map a bit more, test your macro and micro skills and to test
                    yourself against a competitive opposition. Build up your base and defence, see what each building
                    has to offer (different units and technologies) and train the relevant troops you think will help
                    you defeat the enemy army.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My army advice:
                    <li>Train Galleys and use them from range in the ocean to disrupt the land enemy forces from
                        advancing on to your base with a considerable sized force.</li>
                    <li>A good mixture of infantry and range units (10 x Militia and 10 x Archers) should be able to
                        advance on the enemy base and destroy the Watch Tower.</li>

            <div class="aoeObjectivesList">
                <ul>
                    <li>Objectives:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Capture 3 relics and garrison them in your Monastery.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The relics are placed around the map as follows:
                    <li>One is close to your base</li>
                    <li>The other is next to your ally's base</li>
                    <li>The last relic is inside the walls of the enemy base</li>
                    Once the relics are garrisoned inside the monastery, you will receive gold automatically at a slow
                    rate.
                </p>
                <p>Build a market up quickly to start trading with your ally. You will be able to gain your ally's line
                    of sight around the map which is quite advantageous. A market also helps to get access to specific
                    resources quicker.</p>
                <p>
                    My army advice:
                    <li>Monks are the only units that can pick up the relics. They also help heal all non siege units
                        and convert enemy units to join your army.</li>
                    <li>10 x Crossbowmen (Good against infantry), 5 x Militia (Good against Buildings and Infantry) and
                        Pikemen (Good against Cavalry) and 5 Scouts (Good against archers) should be enough to take down
                        the gates and detroy the enemy force.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Objectives:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Build a Castle</li>
                            <li>Destroy the English Castle</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p> Quickly build the walls to block off attacks and upgrade to Feudal Age.  William Wallace's army will arrive and you will have to 2 War Galleys to harrass the English army when the units cross over to the same land where your base is situated.
                </p>
                <p> Build a Castle close to the walls to use as a ranged defensive building, and then advance the Imperial Age to start building Trebuchets.  Build a Dock where William Wallace's army arrive to build more fishing boats and war galleys.</p>
                <p>
                    My army advice:
                    <li>5 x Siege Trebuchets</li>
                    <li>10 Cavaliers and the army William Wallace (14 Elite Woad Raiders and a couple of Paladins) provides should be sufficient to support the siege trebuchets.</li>
