                    <li>Objectives:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Defend the base.</li>
                            <li>Light the signal fire (gather wood stockpiles)</li>
                            <li>Destroy all Great Bombard units.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>This mission dives you straight into the deep end and you are constantly attacked by enemy units.
                    Your
                    villagers are working out of the fort (top of your screen), while you are trying to defend your base
                    inside the walls.</p>
                <p>The goal is to try hold out until the cavalry arrives, I recommend building 5
                    of each unit from the barracks outside the fort, take them up to the top left hand of your screen
                    and wait for the trigger
                    to light the signal fire (you will need villagers to gather the wood).</p>
                <p>Enemy units will try take
                    out your villagers but if you have enough units to defend them, it should
                    be enough for the villagers to gather the wood stock pile.</p>
                <p>When the villagers have gathered all
                    the wood stockpiles, the cavalry units will arrive and drive off the remaining enemy units.

            <p>Apologies for the shortened video, had some technical issues recording the remainder of the mission. I
                will redo the mission and add in a new video.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Objectives:
                        <h4>Primary:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Defend base.</li>
                            <li>Destroy the Enemy's weapon cache in the mines (8x)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Secondary:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Build an Artillary Foundry and train 10x Hoop Throwers</li>
                            <li>Gather all supplies from the shipwreck.</li>
                            <li>Gather all Treasures.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>You start off with a reasonable size army to defend your base. Build up your army (Hoop Throwers are
                    decent units and training 10 helps with a secondary objective).</p>
                <p>Build Fishing Boasts to fish for Food (There is no real threat from the sea so no need to waste your
                    resources on a naval fleet).</p>
                <p>Try claim all treasures and supplies to get resources quicker.</p>
                <p>Once you have a good sized army (5 of each unit plus 10 x hoop throwers), destroy their bases and
                    move into the mines to destroy the enemies remaining units and weapon caches.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Build a Town Center.</li>
                            <li>Build a Barracks and Dock.</li>
                            <li>Locate and gather all Navigation Charts (3x)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Secondary:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Build another Town Center.</li>

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Build a strong base and 20-30 units to defend your base.</p>
                <p>Building a large sized Naval Fleet is the key to winning this mission and achieving objectives. (You
                    do receive a Galleon every couple of minutes or so, try save up as many Galleons as you can.)</p>
                <p>The enemy base is well protected just west of your starting position, try attack them from the south
                    and build mortars to take out their Outposts and Buildings quickly. Support the artillary units with
                    cavalry and crossbowmen.</p>
                <p>Galleons also provide training units, get the Galleon close to a shoreline and build units to support
                    your main army.</p>

                <p>Build up an army (30-40 units) to quickly defend against increment attacks from the enemy force. </p>
                <p>For the Secondary objective, you only need your main warship to take down the enemy fleet and docks.</p>
                <p>Destroy their ally (native) buildings and rebuild a trade shop to get access to additional units and technology.</p>
                <p>Artillery is advantageous to take down the enemy buildings from range.</p>
