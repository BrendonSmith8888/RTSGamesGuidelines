                <p>The first few missions on this campaign are tutorials to demonstrate how you can play the game. Just follow yhe
                    instructions, look at hints before you start the mission and do some research to help you with fidning out more
                    information on the game. This first mission
                    objective is just to train 7 villagers (Click on the Town Center to train villagers). Villagers cost 50 Food each
                    and you will need to build an additonal house
                    (30 Wood)
                    to increase the population capacity (Click on a villager and look for the house image. Once clicked, place your
                    house anywhere on the map). Gather food by collecting berries or hunting animal (be weary of
                    alligators/crocodiles/lions/elephants, they will attack you if you try hunt them).

                <p>In this mission, you need to learn about building 3 key buildings: a Granary (120 Wood), a Storage Pit (120 Wood) and
                    a Dock (100 Wood).
                    You need to gather wood in order to build these buildings. Order your villagers to go gather wood then build each of
                    the buildings.
                <ul>
                    <li>Dock: this building allows you to build different ship units.</li>
                    <li>Granary: this building allows you to upgrade and build walls and towers (defensive buildings). Also allows
                        villagers to store from from berries only.</li>
                    <li>Storage Pit: this building allows villagers to store all resources and provides attacking and defensive upgrades

                    alternative ways to win this scenario.
                    Either by discovering the 5 landmarks or by eliminating the AI player through military conquest. Note you will only
                    have villagers to defend yourself so train up as many as you can before going to look for the landmarks.

                <p>This scenario shows the player how to advance to the next Age (in this case: the Tool Age). To advance to the next
                    age, you will need 500 Food and require 2 Stone Age buildings (build either a Barracks, Dock, Granary or STorage
                    Pit).
                    Reaching new Ages will allow a player to build new buildings, train new units and have access to new
                    technologies/upgrades.

                <p>This scenario teaches the player on how to use military units. You have 4 Axemane (Infantry Unit) and 3 Bowmen
                    (Archery Unit).
                    Axeman are good for tanking and holding off other infantry and cavalry unit, while bowmen can attack from range.
                    Take this scenario to learn different ways to attack and menuevre your forces. My suggestion: Try keep all your
                    units together and piock off enemy units one by one.

                <p>Another way for the player to gather food is to farm. Building Farms (50 Wood) will allow villagers to gather food
                    (the amount of food varies per upgrade). Build a Market (150 Wood) to allow yourself to start building Farms and
                    view the technologies and upgrades in the Market building to improve your villagers work rate for gathering
                    resources. Make sure you build a sizeable defence against the enemy army, they will start attacking you in
                    intervals.</p>

                <p>Another way of gathering gold is through trade. Trade Boat/Merchant Ships can be used to gather gold in exchange for

                <ul>Hints:
                    <li>To make your life easier, build at least 5 Scout ships to control the seas and drive off invading enemy ships.

                </ul>
                <p>One of the more difficult scenarios to tackle, you have to convert the enemy Stone Thrower and make sure it does not
                    get destroyed within the cross fire/battle and guide the Siege Tower back to your Town Center. Priests are the only
                    unit you can use to convert other units, so make sure you protect your priest at all cost. Try distract the enemy
                    archers and units with your other units and make sure your priest focuses on the Stone Thrower (you may have to
                    maneuvre your priest if the STone Thrower starts shotting at you). I got lucky after I
                    converted the Stone Thrower, the rest of the enemy army was distracted with my villagers and I was able to guide the
                    Stone Thrower back to my Town Center with relative ease.</p>

                        <li>Once they enemy is defeated, build a Transport ship and transport 5-10 Villagers (To defeat the Lion and build up

                <p>Building up a defence as quickly as possible will help make this scenario easier to control. You have allies which
                    will help with gathering gold through trade. There is a huge stockpile of stone to the East of your location, you
                    will have to chop through some trees to get throuhg to the stone. A stockpile of gold is located at the West of your
                    lcoation, but is heavily guarded by the enemy team. You need to advance to Iron Age (1000 Food and 800 Gold) and
                    gather 1000 Wood, 1000 Stone and 1000 Wood to build a Wonder.</p>
