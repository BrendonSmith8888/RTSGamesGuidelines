                    information on the game. This first mission
                    objective is just to train 7 villagers (Click on the Town Center to train villagers). Villagers cost 50 Food each
                    and you will need to build an additonal house
                    (30 Wood)
                    to increase the population capacity (Click on a villager and look for the house image. Once clicked, place your
                    house anywhere on the map). Gather food by collecting berries or hunting animal (be weary of
                    alligators/crocodiles/lions/elephants, they will attack you if you try hunt them).

                <!-- <p>The last scenario of the Glory of Greece campaign will test you. Red army will immediately start building a wonder.
                    Hints:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Train a scout to go scout the terrain for your forces to follow before you attack. </li>
                        <li>Build up 5 Catapults to and immediately go attack the tower and the Wonder for Red. (Upgrade Craftmanship to
                            gain extra range.)</li>
                        <li>Pull back your units to a safe location. Build up 5 Triremes and 5 Catapult Triremes to defend yourself againt
                            Naval fleets.</li>
                        <li>Before the Persian army (Brown) starts building their wonder, use a scout and go east. There is path to the
                            Persian army's main base where they will start building a wonder.</li>
                        <li>Have a range of cavalry and centurion units to defend your catapults against attacks while you concentrate your
                            catapult firing on the wonder.</li>
                        <li>You do have a break in between destroying Red's Wonder and Brown starting their wonder. Use the time to destroy
                            Yellow's base in the South with Triremes and Catapult Triremes.</li>
                        <li>Use your catapult triremes to destroy Towers around the flagged area, and once you have enough resources (1000
                            Gold, 1000 Stone, 1000 Wood), build a Wonder in the flagged area.</li>
