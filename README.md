# RTSGamesGuidelines Website

One of my projects to showcase my web development skills.  I'm a massive fan of RTS games.

This is just a guideline to show new/experience players on how to play some of my favourite strategy games.  The website also provides additional stats and information about the buildings, units, and some capaign scenarios.

Any advise will be appretiated.
